                <p>Hi, my name is Yvette; online better known as NutsSweets — or just Nuts (she/her)!</p>
                <p>I'm 41 years old and living in the south of the Netherlands, happily married to MrSweetsNuts aka MrNuts, and I'm a proud full-time stay-at-home mom of two beautiful boys:
                💙 Our first son was stillborn ✨ – I talk about that openly during streams, so you're welcome, but know that this topic comes up sometimes.
                💙 Our second son is a fantastic, active, and delightfully chaotic 9-year-old — better known as NutsJr (LilNuts, or MiniNuts).</p>
                <p>I started my journey on Twitch in March 2021 during Covid, because I wanted to interact with people who felt lonely, little did I know that my channel would grow like this and that I would be such an Inspiration for many with my daily affirmation messages (in Discord and on my socials)
                I'm a real chatterbox who loves to stream a wide variety of comfy and cosy games. Why comfy? Because I bring enough chaos with me — although I blame my community for that too (you know who you are 👀🤣).
                One of the benefits of my streaming journey and going to events as TwitchCon is; having the chance to meet up with people who support you and vice versa but also the people you get to know all over the world.</p>
                <p>Since September 2025 I started with Co-working, so I could help others get into structure with little breaks in between (50/10 pomo’s) as it helped me during a dark period in my life to get back my structure and don’t get lost in every thought that was in my head.</p>
                <p>Feel at home, laugh along with the craziness, and most importantly, be yourself. <span class="heart">♥</span></p>
